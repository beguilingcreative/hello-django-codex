# Hello Django Codex

This example project demonstrates a minimal Django application with a simple message board. It highlights a few Django features:

- Use of the ORM through a `Message` model.
- Rendering templates with Bootstrap styling.
- Basic usage of forms to create new records.

## Quick start

Install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

Then open <http://localhost:8000/> in your browser.
